          <p>
            Orchestrator.js offers web-based IDE for implementing apps in heterogenous, multi-user and multi-device environment. The Web Console can be used for implementing the apps, interactions, and device capabilities. Moreover, the IDE offers tools for testing purposes: it is easy to monitor device states, read debug messages directly from web browser's console, and also developers can manually trigger interactions for a predefined set of devices.

            OJS currently runs in Amazon cloud, but is freely available from <a href="http://github.com/nikkis/OrchestratorJS">GitHub</a>, and can be easily hosted on any computer with a network connectivity. The devices are constantly connected to the Orchestrator.js. On client-side we currently support Android, iOS, and devices capable of running Python/Qt.

          <p>With Orchestrator.js it is easy to implement context-aware applications for a heterogenous set of device. The middleware offers publish-subsrcibe API that is easy to utilize in app implementations. The devices constantly report their state to the Orchestrator.js Device Registry, which publishes updates whenever devices' contextual data changes.</p>

          <p>1) Devices connected to OJS measure their context with their sensors, and report this to Device Registry</p>
          <p>2) When the data changes (newValue != oldValue), Device Registry publishes the change through pub/sub API.</p>
          <p>3) Applications (Apps) run in cloud and receive events through pub/sub API, and also can monitor other sources, e.g. by polling with HTTP.</p>
          <p>4) An app then decides when the context of a device is right and tries triggering an action with REST API.</p>
          <p>5-7) When OJS receives the trigger, it fetches receurces from repositories.</p>
          <p>8-11) Finally, OJS begins the coordination process, commanding participants with their capabilities.</p>

          <p>The applications in Orchestrator.js are based on Action-oriented Programming Model (AcOP). This programming model has the following three main concepts:</p>
          <p>
            <b>Apps</b> monitor device contexts, and out-side sources like social media services, such as Facebook, Twitter and so on. Based on the observations and logic defined by the developer, the app triggers actions. So app defines <i>when and what interactions (actions) should take place.</i>
          </p>
          <p>
            <b>Actions</b> define <i>how the devices interact with each other and as well as with users</i>. An action can be very short, like just greeting each other, or long-lasting, like a game.
          </p>
          <p>
            <b>Capabilities</b> are used to describe <i>how a device appears to the system,</i>
            <i>what a device can or is allowed to do</i>, and <i>in what interactions the device can take part to</i>. The capability can either be very generic, like Talking-capability that allows device to speak, or more specific, like Apocalympics-capability which allows the device to participate to Apocalympics game.

          <p>Lately we have been working with BLE support for OJS.</p>

          <p>Basically this means that the devices can now be coordinated with two paradigms (A) and (B).</p>
          <!--<p>Whereas in paradigm A.1 the server coordinates all the devices, in A.2 one of the devices participating into an action receives a trigger from OJS (B.1), and downloads the action definition JavaScript from server (B.2) before it begins the coordination process A.2.</p>-->
          <p>A) In the new paradigm one of the devices participating into an action receives a trigger from OJS through its Communication Layer (A.1), then downloads the action definition JavaScript from server, and finally begins the coordination process (A.2), coordinating itself as well as other participants.</p>

          <p>B) In the old paradigm Orchestrator Core (a centralized server) was coordinating all the participating devices (B.1 and B.2).</p>
          <p>C) We have also added a support for detecting orher devices and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IBeacon">BLE beacons (iBeacon)</a>.</p>
